Stuffed Artichokes

4 artichokes
Parmesan cheese
parsely
bread crumbs
olive oil

1.) Wash artichokes and cut off stems and tops.
2.) Pound the artichoke against a cutting board to open it up.
3.) Steam in a saute pan half-filled with salted water for one hour.
4.) Finely chop parsely.  Added to bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.
Freshly grated parmesan is best, but other types are also good.
5.) With a spoon, insert the stuffing into the artichokes, trying to
push it down between the leaves.
6.) Drizzle olive oil on top.
7.) Cover and cook for 20 more minutes.
